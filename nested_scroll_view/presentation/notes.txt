Slide 1 — Title
 - Cue: Hi — I’ll show what NestedScrollView does and why it’s useful.
 - Time: 15-20s

Slide 2 — What it does
 - Cue: It coordinates a header that can shrink while the lists below keep scrolling.
 - Time: 90-100s

Slide 3 — Key parts
 - Cue: The main pieces are SliverAppBar for the outer header and a TabBarView or ListView for the inner area.
 - Time: 90-100s

Slide 4 — Demo & Takeaway
 - Cue: Now I’ll show the demo — watch the header collapse while the inner content scrolls.
 - Time: 60-75s

Tips:
 - Start the demo by scrolling slowly so the header collapses visibly.
 - If you need to shorten time, cut 30–60s from Slide 2 or Slide 3.
